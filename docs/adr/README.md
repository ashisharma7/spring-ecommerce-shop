# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the project.

ADRs document **why** certain architectural and design decisions were made.
They are intentionally lightweight and are meant to preserve context for
future maintainers and reviewers.

## What belongs here
- Design trade-offs
- Rejected alternatives
- Non-obvious decisions
- Constraints that influenced architecture

## What does NOT belong here
- Code documentation
- How-to guides
- Implementation details

Each ADR is immutable once accepted. If a decision changes, a new ADR
should be created to supersede the previous one.
